## Usage
Setuo your lesson and then match what you see.

#### Lesson setup
Click the "Start Matching" button to begin. Select the hiragana sets you want to practice with and then click the "Start!" button to begin the lesson.

You can also adjust the difficulty (from 1 to 3). This changes how many characters will be presented at a time.
