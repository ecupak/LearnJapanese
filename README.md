## Summary
This has a bit of a misleading name. It's a simple recognition test of hiragana characters.

This is an Excel file and only runs in the desktop version.

## Usage
Setup your lesson and then match what you see.

#### Lesson setup
Click the "Start Matching" button to begin. Select the hiragana sets you want to practice with and then click the "Start!" button to begin the lesson.

You can also adjust the difficulty (from 1 to 3). This changes how many characters will be presented at a time.

#### Matching
Enter the romanji that match the hiragana characters that you see. The top of the screen shows all hiragana characters and their corresponding romanji. It will automatically pull up the next set to match once you have the correct answer.

There's no time limit or goal. Select new sets and difficulty whenever you want and click "Start!" again.
