A bit of a misleading name. It's an Excel VBA project that tests recognition of hiragana characters.

Click the "Start Matching" button to begin.

Select the 'sounds' you want to practice with.

Adjust difficulty (from 1 to 3). This sets how many characters will be presented at a time.

Click the "Start!" button to begin the lesson.

Enter the romanji sounds that you see. It will automatically pull up the next set to match once you have the correct answer.

There's no time limit or goal. Select new sounds and difficulty whenever you want and click "Start!" again.
